# WEEK-8-PYTHON-PROJECT-PLP
## 📊 COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries and time periods. Using Python data tools, we clean real-world datasets, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends.

By the end, you'll have a well-documented data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
✅ Import & clean COVID-19 global data 

✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations) 

✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions 

✅ Visualize trends using charts and maps 

✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## 🔹 Dataset Sources
Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset (CSV & API)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python

pandas → Data processing

matplotlib / seaborn → Data visualization

plotly → Interactive charts

Jupyter Notebook → Documentation & code execution
